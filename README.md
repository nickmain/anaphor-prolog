## Anaphor Prolog
A Prolog compiler with an emphasis on running in and generating code for as many places as possible.

### Key goals:
* Reach: run identically on many platforms
* Speed: have reasonable performance, try to beat SWI Prolog
* Standards: move towards ISO compliance
* Extensibility: easy to implement native predicates
* Constraints: include a full Constraint Handling Rules system

### Philosophy:
Anaphor Prolog is a meta-programming and knowledge encoding language rather than the language that is used in performance-critical loops. It will provide a REPL but will most frequently be embedded in other applications.
